Penn State's [COVID 19 Dashboard](https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiMDFhMzI2YzQtNmQwNC00YjgzLWFjMzAtZmFlNGQyZGZiZGJhIiwidCI6IjdjZjQ4ZDQ1LTNkZGItNDM4OS1hOWMxLWMxMTU1MjZlYjUyZSIsImMiOjF9) looks and works terribly. 

This project will scrape the most important data from the dashboard. Over time, I would like to add optional push notifications for changes. These changes are typically published by the university on Tuesday and Friday afternoons.
